# To-Do List Application

Welcome to my first JavaScript project! This To-Do List app allows you to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed, all built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Overview

This project is a simple, interactive to-do list app where you can:
- Add new tasks.
- Remove tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed or not completed.
- Keep track of your tasks in an easy-to-use interface.

## Features

- **Add a task**: Enter a task description and click "Add" to add it to the list.
- **Delete a task**: Click the "Delete" button next to any task to remove it from the list.
- **Mark as completed**: Click on a task to toggle between "completed" and "not completed" states.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For the styling of the to-do list.
- **JavaScript**: For the functionality to interact with the to-do list (adding, removing, and completing tasks).

## How to Use

1. Open the project folder and find the `index.html` file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
3. Use the "Add Task" input field to type in tasks and click the "Add" button to add them to your to-do list.
4. Click on any task to mark it as completed or not.
5. Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.

## Installation

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file with any browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to start using the app.

## Future Improvements

- Add the ability to store tasks in `localStorage` so they persist across page reloads.
- Add categories for tasks or deadlines.
- Enhance styling with animations or more advanced UI/UX features.

## Acknowledgements

This is my first project in JavaScript, and I am excited to continue learning and building more projects! Thank you for checking out my To-Do List app.
